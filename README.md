# 🔥 Auto Fire Chaser and Extinguisher Robot 🤖

This project is an Arduino-based smart fire-chasing robot that detects fire using IR sensors and extinguishes it using a water/spray pump. It can automatically sense the direction of fire and navigate towards it to extinguish the flame using a servo-controlled nozzle.
